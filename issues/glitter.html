          <p>
            Who doesn’t love a little sparkle and shine? Unfortunately, glitter,
            which is usually made of plastic, has a deadly impact on the
            environment. Scientists and environmental activists alike are
            calling for this treasured substance to be either regulated or
            banned completely.

            <h2>Small But Deadly</h2>
            <p>
              Glitter, commonly found in cosmetics, is essentially small pieces
              of plastics. These microplastics are especially dangerous when
              washed down the drain. Because of their size, they can easily make
              their way into waterways and oceans, where they especially pose a
              threat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually less than five millimeters, microplastics are especially
              appealing as food for oceanic animals. Whether coming from plastic
              in cosmetics or broken down plastic trash, estimates place the
              number of microplastics in the ocean up to 51 trillion pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
              Microplastics can be consumed by fish, plankton, and similar
              marine life as well as seabirds, where plastic builds up in the
              stomach and cause starvation.
            </p>
            <p>
              These microplastics could easily move up the food chain into our
              own dinner plates.
            </p>
            <p>
              Glitter is usually made from aluminium and a plastic called PET.
              Dr Trisia Farrelly, an environmental anthropologist at Massey
              University in New Zealand, studied PET and found that the plastic,
              when broken down, could release disruptive chemicals and toxins in
              animals and humans that were linked to cancer and neurological
              diseases. She calls for an all encompassing ban on glitter.
            </p>

            <h4>
              “All glitter should be banned because it’s microplastic and all
              microplastics leak into the environment.”
            </h4>

            <p>
              Cosmetic glitter is especially dangerous. “These are literally
              'down the drain' products. You put it on and you wash it off. They
              are made to be disposed of,” Dr. Farrelly explains. The rise of
              social media and glam makeup, though, has only made cosmetic
              glitter more and more popular, especially amongst young adults.
            </p>
            <p>
              A ban on glitter may be difficult because of a current lack of
              concrete data on glitter. Regardless, cosmetic glitter is deadly
              to marine life As Dr. Farrelly says, avoiding cosmetic glitter is
              a “no brainer.”

            <h2>Microbeads: An Unlikely Comparison</h2>
            <p>
              In 2015, a bill eliminating the use of microbeads in wash-off
              cosmetic products by mid-2017 was officially signed in the United
              States. In the United Kingdom, the restriction on microbeads went
              into effect in 2018. These measures came into effect after
              scientists discovered the dire consequences of microbeads.
            </p>
            <p>
              Microbeads are also tiny plastic particles, usually smaller than
              two millimeters. In the beauty industry, they were widely used in
              products like face scrubs, shower gels, body wash, and toothpastes
              for exfoliation and scrubbing debris from the skin. Cheap and easy
              to produce, companies chose to include microbeads in their
              products rather than natural alternatives like apricot shells,
              jojoba beans, and pumice. The small spheres are meant to be washed
              down the drain after one use.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like glitter, they can slip past wastewater treatment plants and
              travel into oceans, bays, and gulfs. Before the restrictions,
              about 808 trillion microbeads swirled down American drains daily.
              About 8 trillion of those microbeads escape wastewater treatment
              plants and were released into waterways.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once in the ocean, microbeads added to the harmful effects of
              plastic pollution in the ocean. Their size allowed them to be
              easily be swallowed by even the smallest marine animals and travel
              up the food chain. They also transferred and released toxic
              chemical additives into the sea.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some microbead pollutants have similar health concerns to glitter,
              as they have been linked to cancer, development issues, and birth
              defects.
            </p>
            <p>
              The restrictions on microbeads are a step in the right direction.
              Unfortunately, plastic microbead bans are just a drop in the
              bucket. The bans will not make microbeads that are already in our
              waterways disappear, nor will they stop companies from including
              plastic or glitter in their cosmetics.
            </p>
            <p>
              The similarities between microbeads and glitter are uncanny. While
              the former served as an exfoliant and the latter is used primarily
              for glitz and glam, both are microplastics with deadly effects.
              Stopping at microbead restrictions will not do much for our
              environment. If microbeads needed to be banned for their
              environmental impact, so does glitter.

            <h2>A Biodegradable Alternative</h2>
            <p>
              Luckily, innovative companies have started creating and stocking
              biodegradable glitter. These glitters are usually compostable and
              plant-based, so they’ll break down rather than remaining in the
              environment for hundreds of years. Swap out your plastic, cosmetic
              glitter with these biodegradable glitter brands:
              <a href="https://ecostardust.com/" target="_blank">EcoStarDust</a
              >,
              <a href="https://www.ecoglitterfun.com/" target="_blank"
                >Eco Glitter Fun</a
              >,
              <a href="http://www.the-mermaid-cave.co.uk/" target="_blank"
                >The Mermaid Cave</a
              >, and
              <a href="https://wildglitter.com/" target="_blank">Wild Glitter</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other cosmetic chains like Lush have replaced all the glitter in
              their products with synthetic, biodegradable alternatives, or
              “starched-based lusters.” The company also advises to avoid being
              part of the problem by “checking labels of all your cosmetics to
              determine if they contain any plastic-based materials.” Lush,
              EcoStarDust, and similar brands show how sometimes, the most
              effective solution is top-down: action from brands to consumers.
