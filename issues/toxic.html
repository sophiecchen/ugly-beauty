          <h1>Toxic Ingredients</h1>
          <p>
            Unlike food, the beauty industry lacks any comprehensive regulation.
            However, these products still come in contact with our skin,
            possibly being absorbed, before being washed off into the oceans and
            posing a threat to marine animals and other wildlife.

            <h2>Little Regulation</h2>
            <p>
              How is a beauty product checked for safety? In order for a product
              to hit the market, it only as to be checked for color additives
              and over-the-counter drugs. Thus, many ingredients irritate and
              penetrate the skin or are endocrine disruptors. The nonprofit
              Environmental Working Group, or EWG, found one “known or probable
              carcinogen” in every 120 cosmetic products on the United States
              market, those products ranging from lip balm to to shampoo.
              Because of this, thoroughly checking ingredients before buying any
              cosmetic product is vital for both the consumer and the
              environment.

            <h2>Ingredients to Avoid</h2>
            <p>
              These are some toxic ingredients common in beauty products that
              should be avoided for the safety of both the consumer and the
              environment.

            <h3>Microbeads</h3>
            <p>
              Even though
              <a href="glitter.html" title="Go to Glitters Galore page"

              >
              might be banned in many western countries, the regulations are not
              all encompassing. Watch out for toothpaste, face washes, shampoo,
              eyeliner, and lip gloss that contains microbeads or plastic,
              possibly labeled as polypropylene or polyethylene, when shopping
              online.

            <h3>Titanium Dioxide</h3>
            <p>
              Titanium dioxide, or TiO2, can be found in skin tints and
              mineral-based makeup. The compound can alter freshwater snail DNA
              and harm phytoplankton growth. Phytoplankton produces oxygen for
              both marine animals and humans. Titanium dioxide’s effects on the
              organism could severely disrupt ecosystems.

            <h3>Triclosan</h3>
            <p>
              Triclosan is antimicrobial chemical. It disrupts hormones and
              irritates the skin. Alarmingly, triclosan has also been found in
              the Great Lakes: because it does not degrade quickly, it
              accumulates and causes long term issues and reacts with other
              chemicals to form toxins. Triclosan both reduces the lifespans and
              changes the biochemistry of aquatic animals.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Chemical Sunscreen</h3>
            <p>
              Sunscreen can either be mineral or chemical. Mineral sunscreen
              reflects UV rays, but it feels more sunscreen-like, which some
              people dislike. Chemical sunscreens, on the other hand, absorb UV
              light rather than reflecting it. Their light feel is more popular
              than mineral sunscreen.
            </p>
            <p>
              The two most common chemical sunscreen chemicals are oxybenzone
              and octinoxate; both are toxic to corals. Coral reefs, which could
              be 90% gone by 2050, provide food, coastal protection, and
              habitats to marine life. Oxybenzone is especially dangerous. It
              disrupts coral DNA and hormones such that baby coral encase
              themselves and die.
            </p>
            <p>
              These chemicals can easily travel into oceans by washing off the
              sunscreen in a shower or playing at the beach, and 6,000 to 14,000
              metric tons of sunscreen lotions end up in coral reef areas
              annually.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chemical sunscreens also can be absorbed by the skin into the
              bloodstream. These chemicals can disrupt hormones and are linked
              with cellular damage and cancer.
            </p>

            <h3>Parabens</h3>
            <p>
              Parabens are a type of preservative commonly found in cosmetics.
              Parabens are also partially responsible for killing off corals.
              They disrupt hormones in marine life, and overwhelming evidence
              shows that parabens from our daily lives are traveling to
              wildlife, building up in the tissue of bears, birds, and marine
              life.
            </p>

            <p>
              Parabens are also linked with a greater risk of breast cancer
              since they have estrogen-mimicking properties.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Fragrance</h3>
            <p>
              Fragrance itself is not necessarily toxic. However, “fragrance” is
              a catch-all word that refers to a company’s secret formula.
              Chemicals toxic to humans and the environment like phthalates,
              which have been linked to breast cancer and reproductive birth
              defects, could be included without being disclosed. Fragrance has
              been linked to allergies and irritation as well. Look for soaps,
              cleaners, shampoos, and perfume without fragrances.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="noneBottom" id="check">
            <h2>Check Before You Buy</h2>
            <p>
              Next time you buy a makeup product, you should also take a glance
              at the ingredients. Because cosmetics are coming in direct contact
              with your skin, it is especially important to make sure that these
              ingredients are safe and non-toxic.Toxic ingredients are far more
              common in makeup than you realize.
            </p>
            <p>
              Avoid microbeads, titanium dioxide/TiO2, parabens, triclosan,
              chemical sunscreen, and "fragrance."
