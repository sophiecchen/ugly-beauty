          <h1>Company Irresponsibility</h1>
          <p>
            With a new surge of young consumers interested in clean beauty and
            eco-friendly products, many companies recognize the advantages of
            green cosmetics. Rather than redesigning their products to be more
            eco-friendly, though, they use misleading marketing to attract
            customers.

            <h2>Greenwashing</h2>
            <p>
              To put it simply, greenwashing is when a brand, product, action,
              etc. is deceptively marketed as environmentally friendly when it
              actually is not.
            </p>
            <figure class="imageTall">
              <img
                src="../images/market.jpg"
                alt="flowers surrounding the lipsticks and cream"
              />
              <figcaption>
                The flowers surrounding the lipsticks and cream connect the
                products to to nature.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Companies, cross-industry, do it because this deceptive marketing
              gives increases their profits and reputation. 66% of people
              globally are willing to pay more for environmentally sustainable
              products while 72% of millennials, who make up a large portion of
              the beauty industry, are willing to pay more.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the beauty industry, this manifests usually with green or
              nature-inspired packaging and labels like “natural” and
              “chemical-free.” Packaging with bright pictures of flowers,
              plants, or fruit, for example, help convince the consumer that the
              product is somehow connected with nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              When looking out for greenwashing, watch for deceptive packaging
              and marketing. An image may illustrate the product with flowers or
              nature, but that does not necessarily mean that the brand is
              eco-friendly. In fact, these pictures are often ironically printed
              on colored plastic that cannot be recycled and harm marine life.
              For example, the cups below have "eco" printed on them in green.
              However, the cups are plastic, and thus are inherently damaging to
              the environment.
            </p>

              <img
                src="../images/greenwash.jpg"
                alt="plastic cups with eco lables"
              />
              <figcaption>
                These cups ironically have labels that read "eco" despite being
                made of plastic.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Deceptive words organic, natural, and chemical-free are signs of
              possible greenwashing. Neither organic or natural are FDA defined,
              and they may not apply to all ingredients. Having some “natural”
              or “organic” ingredients does not mean that there aren’t toxins in
              the product. “Nature makes plenty of toxic things,” notes Dr.
              Richard Blackburn, sustainability expert and chemist. Likewise,
              chemical-free does not mean toxin-free. Not all chemicals are
              harmful.

          <section>
            <h2>Brand Responsibility</h2>
            <p>
              Greenwashing is an especially potent issue in the overall problem
              of brand responsibility. Too often cosmetic brands blame the
              consumer for failing to recycle when the brand itself is often
              responsible for manufacturing waste and creating those
              difficult-to-recycle products in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is important for consumers to make good decisions, but often
              this environmental action is interfering at the wrong place of the
              supply chain. The environment needs to be kept in mind from the
              very beginning of a product’s creation, so brands need to be
              checked and held accountable by the public.
