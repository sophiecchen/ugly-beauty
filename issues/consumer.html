          <h1>Consumer Culture</h1>
          <p>
            A large part of environmental concerns come from the fact that we
            consume too much. Our world tells us that more is always better, but
            when it comes to more plastic and more toxins in the environment,
            this sentiment couldn't be more false.

            <h2>A Need for More</h2>
            <p>
              We are constantly surrounded by media: advertising is on buses,
              videos, TV, and billboards. Along with flex culture, society today
              measures someone's prestige by their material goods. Companies use
              events like Black Friday to convice consumers to buy more and
              more.
            </p>

              <figcaption>
                Theses billboards are just one way advertisers bombard consumers
                with a need for more material goods.

            <p>
              The issue with having so many cosmetics is the cosmetics rarely
              get fully used. Each person only has one face, and having 20 lip
              products is unnecessary. Each cosmetic product leaves a footprint
              on the earth from not only the waste from packaging and containers
              after it has been bought, but also from the energy and water it
              takes to make the product.
            </p>

          <section class="noneBottom">
            <h2>Social Media</h2>
            <p>
              Within the last decade, social media has exploded. Its impact on
              our daily lives is potent, and along with this has come a new wave
              of consumer culture.
            </p>
            <p>
              Companies are taking advantage of Instagram, YouTube, Twitter,
              etc. to promote their products. Whether using social media to
              connect with their customers or getting influencers to sponsor
              their products, this exposure has definitely helped businesses
              grow and people find a voice.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, social media sponsoring is just another form of
              advertising, telling users that they need more, that having a
              certain item will fulfill them and make them happier. That item is
              usually unneeded, and buying it would just create more unnecessary
              waste.
            </p>
            <p>
              Makeup and clothing hauls are another consumerist trend. Beauty
              and fashion influencers and creators buy dozens of products from a
              company at once, sometimes spending hundreds of dollars. After
              trying and reviewing each product for their viewers, too many
              influencers store these products away, rarely touching them again.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hauling encourages a consumerist mindset that you can never have
              enough, that more is better.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, social media and business can be a double-edged sword.
              It can be great exposure businesses like small, eco-friendly
              brands, but it can also pressure consumers into buying more
              unnecessary cosmetics, creating more waste that trashes the
              planet.
