         <h1>Plastic Packaging</h1>
         <p>When buying a product, the packaging is what first catches our eye. It makes products identifiable, and attractive to potential customers. Most cosmetic packaging, though, is made of colorful plastic, which is especially detrimental to the environment.</p>

            <h2>The Issue with Plastic</h2>
            <p>Our seas are in serious danger: plastic is traveling into the ocean at frightening rates. Plastic does not degrade, and so once in the ocean, it collects on coastlines or circulates in a gyre like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, three times the size of France, for practically forever.</p>
            <p>Most plastic doesn’t just float on the surface of the ocean, however. Rather, the material is broken down into small pieces called microplastics.</p>
            <p>Microplastics in the ocean number up to 51 trillion pieces. These microplastics can do serious harm. They can easily be eaten by fish and seabirds, where they build up in the stomach until the animal starves to death. The pieces can also be eaten by plankton, the bottom of the marine food chain: the pieces than move upwards as predators consume their prey until eventually, we end up eating our own trash.</p>
            <p>UNESCO estimated that plastic debris kills at least 100,000 marine mammals and a million seabirds annually, likely more.</p>
            <p>Because of their size, these plastics cannot easily be removed from the sea. Plastic doesn’t degrade either. Thus, the more plastic we make, the more plastic builds up in the oceans. Only 9% of all plastic that has ever been created has been recycled, and much of the plastic waste that doesn’t end up in landfills goes to the ocean through littering, transport errors, and sewers. </p>
    
            <h4>Experts predict that by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.</h4>

              <img src="../images/garbage.jpg" alt="piles of trash, reflecting the vast amount of waste we create">
              <figcaption>These piles of trash reflect the vast amount of waste we create.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Even so, plastic surrounds us. From our school supplies to the coffeemaker in the kitchen, plastic is used in practically every industry, including beauty, were packaging is a giant marketing point. These amount to a huge amount of waste that we produce every year.</p>
            
            <p>Shampoo, mascara, lipstick, and other goods used to be packaged in tin and glass. With the invention of a cheap “miracle” material though, companies began to shift to plastic.</p>
            <p>Today, the beauty industry has a huge issue with plastic. Bottles, cases, and brushes are almost always made of plastic. In 2017 alone, the industry produced 76.8 billion units of plastic packaging, not including all the plastic tools and brushes. After one use, this packaging is thrown out. With all of the products being sold, this collectively amounts to an enormous amount of plastic waste from the beauty industry every single year.</p>

          <section>
            <h2>Marketing and Costs</h2>
            <p>From the brand’s perspective, plastic packaging is simply more cost efficient. Plastic is mass produced, light, cheap, and strong, and using paper packaging, glass, or other alternatives can be more than 60 times the cost, an expense too big, especially for smaller brands.</p>
            <p>The growth of the industry has also made competition fierce. Plastic is the cheapest way to make products stand out: displaying products with bright colored containers attracts customers. Brands do this knowing full well that this only worsens the environmental crisis. Colored plastic usually is not recycled because it cannot be recolored like white and clear plastic. These eye-catching bottles are sure to end in the landfill or ocean after one use.</p>

              <figcaption>These rows of colorful packaging and makeup catch the eye of shoppers.</figcaption>

          <section>
            <h2>Alternatives</h2>
            <p>We are constantly surrounded by plastic, but there are alternatives. Even recycling does not stop new plastic from being made, so it is actually best to avoid plastic packaging altogether. <a href="../forward/brands.html" title="Go to Eco-Friendly Brands page">Companies</a>, especially smaller ones, have taken the initiative to innovate new packageless or plastic-free products like Lush’s packageless shampoo bars, and Kjaer Weis’s refillable steel-packaged products. </p>
            <p>Before you buy a product, take a second to scrutinize the packaging. Is the packaging made of plastic? If so, then it may not be worth your money. Keep in mind that throwing plastic in the recycling bin doesn’t necessarily prevent it from being trashed. Colored plastic and small plastic parts like caps are often sent to the landfill.</p>
            <h4>That one cute palette wrapped in plastic on Instagram isn’t worth the environmental harm it can cause.</h4>
            <p>Even though cosmetic section you frequent may stock mostly cosmetics wrapped in plastic, there are plenty of brands that offer aluminum, paper, or bamboo packaging instead. </p>
