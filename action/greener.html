            <h2>Less is More</h2>
            <p>
              The most effective way to reduce your impact on the environment is
              to reduce the amount of products you own and buy. Most of the
              waste produced in a product comes from the manufacturing side,
              which consumers cannot control. Cutting down on the number of
              products you own and buy reduces the waste created to make the
              product and the waste created after the product is finished.
            </p>

            <p>Before you buy a product, ask yourself these questions:</p>
            <figure class="imageTall">
              <img
                src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0a1fbe3a4aac7fda1fe1feafca7f393b9b7f29b0/cc407/images/lessismore.jpg"

            </figure>
            <p>
              <b>Do I need this makeup product?</b> Many people have numerous
              red lipsticks or a colorful eyeshadow pallet of 40 colors, yet
              they only reach for the same lipstick, the same 4 colors in the
              pallet. If the whole product is not going to be used frequently,
              than it’s not necessary to buy. A similar question you can ask
              yourself is whether makeup is really necessary at all. The beauty
              industry capsizes on our insecurities, and high-coverage
              foundation or full contour is rarely necessary in everyday life.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Will I use all of the product?</b> Keep in mind that makeup
              likely expires faster than you think. If you won't finish at least
              most of the product, then chances are that you won’t use it
              frequently enough to need it. For pallets, also consider whether
              all the colors will be used or just a few. It may be a wiser
              investment to buy separate colors you will definitely use.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Why am I buying this product?</b> Are you buying the product
              because need it as a part of your daily makeup routine or are you
              buying it because it's on sale and was recommended by your
              favorite celebrity? There’s nothing wrong with experimenting with
              different products, but researching well and finishing what you
              have first helps reduce waste.

            <h2>Research, Research, Research</h2>
            <p>
              Checking the ingredients, packaging, and brand boil down to taking
              time to research thoroughly. Information about the ethical impacts
              and environmental impacts of a product should not be difficult to
              find with even just a bit of clicking on the about section of the
              brand website. If it is difficult to find straightforward
              information about a product’s ingredients, sourcing, or
              manufacturing, then the brand lacks transparency.
            </p>
            <p>
              Research on environmentally-friendly brands prevents spontaneous
              buying, and allows you to make well-informed decisions.

            <h2>Eco-Friendly Brands</h2>
            <p>
              Most brands do not have their customers’ best interests in mind.
              Profit is the number one motivator. Therefore, don’t give your
              money to brands who tend to use toxic or harmful ingredients and
              materials. Instead, support brands that respect the environment.
              Choosing to hold brands accountable for the choices they make in
              manufacturing can give other companies incentive to make better,
              eco-friendly decisions. Outside of cosmetics, brand accountability
              can easily be applied to the clothing, personal care, etc
              industries.

              truely green makeup to incorporate into your own routine.

              Elate is a brand that is focused on creating effective products
              safe for both consumers and the environment. Their vegan and
              cruelty-free cosmetics are packaged in bamboo rather than plastic.
              The products are also refillable. The products come with a bamboo
              case and magnetic, stainless steel tins of pressed product. When
              one pressed tin is finished, it can be recycled, and another
              pressed tin can be snapped in its place. This saves packaging and
              allows consumers to choose which colors they want to buy.

              non-toxic and non-GMO; in addition, they are vegan, cruelty-free,
              and gluten-free. Faraday Face products contain no plastic or
              plastic packaging. Rather they use aluminum pans and paperboard
              pallets, which can be recycled, and compostable ribbon. The brand

              Kjaer Weis is a luxury Danish brand that is both well-known and

              organic and not tested on animals. Kirsten Kjaer Weis, founder and
              makeup artist, uses her knowledge of beauty and commitment to the
              environment to create products that are just as high-performing,
              if not more, as luxury but not sustainable brands. Its stainless
              steel compacts are also 100% recyclable and its widely-accessible
              refills are packaged in compostable paper. In humid environments,
              stainless steel is a great sustainable alternative to bamboo,
              which can get moldy.
