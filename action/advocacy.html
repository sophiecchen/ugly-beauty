            Greener cosmetic choices are only a drop in the bucket.
            Environmentally safe products are important, but it ultimately
            intervenes at the wrong stage in the process. Properly addressing
            the environmental impacts of any industry effectively, such as the
            beauty industry, needs to come from top-down.

            <p>
              The more people are aware of makeup's environmental impacts, the
              greater the change people can make. Telling friends, family, or
              others online can also multiply your impact as they also change
              their makeup habits and spread the word.
            </p>

            <h2>Activism and Voting</h2>
            <p>
              By ourselves, there is only so much we can do. Recycling that
              product’s cardboard box does not prevent the gallons of water
              wasted when it was made, nor does it prevent the company from
              choosing poorly sourced ingredients.
            </p>
            <p>
              Making wiser decisions is certainly important, but rallying the
              government and larger coorperations is what will make a difference
              in the long run.
            </p>
            <p>
              We need to be activists and rally for change. Making our voices
              heard is what brings attention to the environmental crisis. From
              demonstrating and protesting to even just spreading word amongst
              family and friends, letting others know about the crisis is just
              as important as taking action individually. One person’s choices
              might not make much of a difference, but whole assemblies of
              environmentally-conscious people will.
            </p>
            <p>
              Politically, not everyone has the power to vote. Those that do,
              however, can use it to hold leaders accountable and elect those
              that will fight for legislation in favor of the earth. Laws and
              legislation can regulate companies, protect consumers from
              deception, and prevent the earth from facing even more harm.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nations need to step up in order to deter the environmental crisis
              that has already come.
